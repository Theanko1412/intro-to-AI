There is probably an error in my code and all errors are bigger than expected, the solution is to remove the "* 0.01" part in setting initial weights and biases. Dont know why genetic algorithm cant escape the local minimum when weights are set with 0.01 deviation with the given mutation koefitient but this solution should be suffitient for 24/24 with a good knowladge of the code and theory behind it.
